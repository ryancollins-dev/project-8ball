# 8Ball

I created this little script which runs automatically when I log into my computer

I placed a task in the Task Scheduler under :: Microsoft > Windows > Work Folders that contains 

the action ``start a program`` with the location of my 8ball.bat file,

This helps me to quickly get in some personal growth time in the morning when I start my day.

Feel free to use this as you wish, the list can be changed to suite your own needs.
